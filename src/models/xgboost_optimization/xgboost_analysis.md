# Analysis of Current XGBoost Implementation

Based on the provided code and project proposal, here's an analysis of the current XGBoost implementation and potential optimization opportunities.

## Current Implementation Overview

The current implementation uses XGBoost for binary classification (price up/down) with the following characteristics:

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Uses historical stock data for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL
   - Adds technical indicators as features
   - Creates binary target variable based on price change

2. **Model Training**:
   - Uses rolling window cross-validation
   - Window size of 90 days with step size of 30 days
   - Trains separate models for different prediction horizons (1, 3, 7, 30, 252 days)

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Computes accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and baseline accuracy
   - Saves results to CSV files

4. **Portfolio Optimization**:
   - Calculates optimal weights based on predicted returns
   - Computes expected portfolio return and variance

5. **Model Interpretability**:
   - Uses SHAP analysis for feature importance

## Optimization Opportunities

Based on the professor's comments and the project requirements, here are key optimization opportunities:

### 1. Rolling vs Expanding Window Comparison
- Current implementation only uses rolling window approach
- Need to implement and compare with expanding window approach
- Analyze which approach performs better for different prediction horizons

### 2. Multiclass Prediction
- Current implementation uses binary classification (up/down)
- Opportunity to implement multiclass prediction:
  - Up by <1%, 1-3%, 3-5%, >5%
  - Down by <1%, 1-3%, 3-5%, >5%
- This provides more granular predictions and potentially more value for users

### 3. Stock Correlation Features
- Current implementation treats each stock independently
- Opportunity to explore correlations between stocks as additional features
- This could improve prediction accuracy by capturing market-wide trends

### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Current implementation may not use optimal hyperparameters
- Opportunity to perform systematic hyperparameter tuning:
  - Learning rate, max depth, subsample, colsample_bytree
  - Number of estimators
  - Regularization parameters (alpha, lambda)

### 5. Feature Engineering Enhancements
- Current implementation uses basic technical indicators
- Opportunity to add more sophisticated features:
  - Market sentiment indicators
  - Volatility measures
  - Sector-specific indicators
  - Macroeconomic features

### 6. Model Evaluation Improvements
- Current evaluation focuses on standard metrics
- Opportunity to add more financial-specific evaluation:
  - Risk-adjusted returns
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Profit/loss analysis

## Next Steps

1. Implement expanding window approach alongside rolling window
2. Develop multiclass prediction framework
3. Create correlation-based features across stocks
4. Set up systematic hyperparameter optimization
5. Enhance feature engineering pipeline
6. Improve evaluation metrics to include financial performance indicators
